<h3>My Opinion</h3>
<p>In my opinion the United States is better than Canada. I beleive the United States is better because there are more pros than the amount of pros for Canada. There are also less cons for the United States than there are for Canada. Another reason the United States is better than Canada is because of the weather. The United States has various ranges of temperatures however, Canada is usually cold and not very nice. I believe the United STates is also better than Canada because of the cities. The U.S has many different types of cities where as Canada has many of the same types of cities. Even though there are less people in Canada, the housing and education is more expensive there than in the United States which is another reason that the U.S is better. In the United States, there are laws that protect every persons freedom which is another reason why it is a better country than Canada. The monuments in America are another reason why they are better than Canada. The statues and monuments in the United States represent the history and culture of Americans. The people in America are friendlier than the people in Canada ehich is another reason the United States is better. The last reason the United States is better than Canada is becaue of the military. The United States military is stronger which gives Americans better protection than the Canadians. Those are the reasons why I believe the United States is better than Canada.&nbsp;</p>
